To deploy the resources defined in your AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model) template, follow these steps:

**Step 1: Prepare Your Environment**
Make sure you have the following prerequisites set up:

- AWS CLI: Install and configure the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) with the necessary IAM permissions.

**Step 2: Create a SAM Deployment Package**

If your code has dependencies, you need to create a deployment package. Assuming your AWS Lambda function's code resides in a directory named "service," use the following command to create a deployment package:

```bash
sam build
```

**Step 3: Deploy Your SAM Application**

Use the following command to deploy your SAM application:

```bash
sam deploy --guided
```

This command will interactively guide you through the deployment process, prompting for various configuration options. You can customize these options based on your requirements. Here are the key configurations to consider:

- **Stack Name**: Provide a unique name for your CloudFormation stack.
- **AWS Region**: Choose the AWS region where you want to deploy your resources.
- **Parameter Overrides**: This will prompt you for parameter values defined in your SAM template. You may need to provide values for `ReportFilesBucket` and `CHAT_GPT_API_KEY`.
- **Confirm changes before deploy**: Review and confirm the changes before deployment.

After you confirm the deployment, AWS SAM will package and deploy your resources as specified in your SAM template.

**Step 4: Access Your Deployed API**

Once the deployment is successful, AWS SAM will provide you with the API Gateway endpoint URL for the "Prod" stage in the output. You can access your deployed API at this URL.

```bash
Outputs:
  ServerlessHttpApi:
    Description: API Gateway endpoint URL for Prod stage
    Value:
      Fn::Sub: https://${ServerlessHttpApi}.execute-api.${AWS::Region}.amazonaws.com/Prod/
```

**Step 5: Test Your Lambda Function**

To test your Lambda function, you can use tools like `curl` or Postman to make a POST request to the `/reports` endpoint with a JSON body containing a "prompt" field.

**Step 6: Cleanup (Optional)**

If you want to remove the resources created by your SAM application, you can use the AWS CLI to delete the CloudFormation stack:

```bash
aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name YourStackName
```

Replace `YourStackName` with the name of your CloudFormation stack.

That's it! You've successfully deployed your SAM application, which includes an AWS Lambda function, an API Gateway, and an S3 bucket, and you can now use it to generate reports based on user prompts.
